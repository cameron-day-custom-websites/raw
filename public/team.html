                Years ago, my sister gave me a Bible. On the cover of that Bible are the words in big letters, “The Way.” Inside those letters is a picture of a solo cyclist breaking away from the peloton. I’ve been inspired and guided by that picture, and 
                more significantly, the words within that cover for most of my life. I am doing RAW/RAAM because I need to proclaim the truth that Jesus gave us in John 14:7, “I am the way and the truth and the life.” I need to be the comforting hands of Jesus to people. I need to show the world that in my suffering from Oceanside, CA to Annapolis, MD. I can provide hope to those who have suffered from trauma and abuse. Because though I suffered from such trauma and abuse, I have overcome the pain of it. I have overcome, and Jesus has been my strength. I am doing RAW/RAAM because I’m not suffering anymore. I am free. Anyone who has suffered trauma and abuse can be free, too. I ride for them. I ride with Jesus. He has given me the strength to overcome it all. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. He is The Way to Victory.    
                Robert Woods is the founder of The Way to Victory Foundation. He is a father of 5, grandfather of 10, and a survivor of trauma himself. He is retired from public service, holds a PhD in educational leadership, and is a licensed Educational Administrator and academic teacher. His doctoral studies focused on transformative learning and synchronicity. Understanding transformative learning has guided his path towards creating the foundation. He will use that understanding to help others experience positive transformation in their lives. Robert is inspired by athletes such as ultramarathoner Scott Jurek, and bicyclist, Greg LeMond. Robert’s life ambition has been to offer love and support to children and adults who have had to endure the horrors of abuse and trauma.

                I started racing bicycles in the 1970’s and I passed that passion on to my brother Rob. We grew up in Otisville NY in the Shawangunk Mtns, foothills to the Catskills. We grew up in and around sports and we both pushed each other to new heights in baseball, football, hockey, and any other local competition, but cycling really took us to a different place. The thrill of achieving a climb of a mountain and the exhilarating descent as a reward was something that helped us free our minds of the pains of growing up. When my brother asked me to be his crew chief, I was not only honored but also excited to spend time with my brother that is only 20 months younger than I am. We recently qualified for RAW in October 2020 by completing NCOM(No Country for Old Men 383 mile) and that is saying something. Only 4 finishers in a very windy and harsh terrain. I know and love my brother and know in his heart and mine that RAW is meant to be. He can do it!!! The Way To Victory is our way of helping the world become a better place. We are focused on helping the too many forgotten children that have suffered from neglect and abuse, and to let them know that there is help and that endurance cycling is not only an outlet to find yourself but to strengthen yourself. We need your help. Thewaytovictory.com.
                As the Crew Chief, my job is to stress out on the little things so Rob doesn’t have to. I truly want us to succeed so that we can be role models to the youngsters like we once were. To show them that anything is possible. ANYTHING!!! I’m looking forward to learning a lot from the others who have gone before us. Lon Haldeman and John Howard inspired us as youngsters and the thought of RAAM has been with us our entire lives. RAW is just the beginning on our journey to raise awareness for our troubled youth on our runup to RAAM 2022. The rest of the crew that surrounds us will help us find our way and they are family to us. There is The Way To Victory. Patience Dedication Understanding and Love!!
                My background is in air freight logistics, 30 years, which has allowed me to visit 46 of the 48 continental US states. I majored in geography which has lead me to my fascination for mapmaking and which puts me in the navigation department for sure. I currently own my own business, Deepwoodsfirestarters.com, which allows me to travel the country and teach fire-starting skills and market my product. I stay near the Appalachian Trail in the fall doing craft and Christmas shows and stay near home in DFW area of Texas most of the rest of the year.
                THANK YOU to all who support us and THANK YOU in advance to all that will support us in the future!!!
                LETS BE THE DIFFERENCE and MAKE A DIFFERENCE!!! THE WAY TO VICTORY!!!

                I thought since I personally do not race bikes I would just share a bike related story from my youth.  I remember my first experience learning to ride a bike. The bike wasn't mine, it was a big heavy adult bike (1960's model).   I was determined to ride that bike, after many failed attempts and a few falls I finally succeeded.  I can remember my excitement when I was able to ride from one end of the block to the other.  I eventually got my own bike  I remember giving some kid in the neighborhood $5 for his bike that lasted me about a week or two, I think I sold it for $4 to somebody that knew how to fix it..  I was ten or eleven years old when I went to the local Firestone store downtown by myself and laid away my first ten speed, it was bright yellow with white wrapped curled handle bars.  I always enjoyed riding my bikes around town over to the park swimming pool and through the woods, popping wheelies and going over jumps.  I still ride today for exercise and pleasure, mostly on bike trails.
                
                I met my friend Ben Woods in the Fall of 2018 either in Columbia SC or Richmond VA.  Ben was selling and demonstrating his fire starters a couple a booths down from me at a show we were vendors in, Ben came over to me and introduced himself, we were doing a lot of the same shows and over a short period of time we became good friends.  In September of 2020 Ben asked me if I would be interested in being a crew member to help his brother Rob in the NCOM bike race held in October of 2020.  I was a little hesitant at first not having any experience and not knowing what to expect, but then I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to experience a part of the country I have never seen and be part of a unique adventure.  I have been living in my van since October 30 2019 so I didn't have to pack, I just filled up my van gas tank and drove to Dallas/Fort Worth area where Ben lives.  We left out a day or two later in my van and met his brother Rob in Alpine TX.  Rob completed the 375 mile NCOM bike race and qualified for RAW and RAAM.  I really enjoyed the experience of the bike race, enjoying it with friends. Tranquility, natural beauty and a few wild animals was part of the perks.  I am looking forward to the next challenge with Rob and the rest of the crew for Race Across the West (RAW) and I will again have the privilege to be a part of his/our journey by doing what is asked of me to the best of my ability to help Rob complete the Race Across the West (RAW).
                  
                I love nature and animals.  I am a pescatarian, a van dweller (by choice) and I like exploring and trying knew things.  My passion growing up was mostly music. Drums are my main instrument, I play guitar just for my personal enjoyment.  I'm planning to bring my Cedar Bongo Cajon to jam out some tunes.
                  
                Thank you for your support of The Way to Victory, Rob Woods and the crew!

                I‘ve have been a life-long lover of cycling, both motor and self-powered. And, have supported Rob Woods as an endurance athlete for a decade or so. His wife and my best friend, Kristen and I have crewed many a race for him. Rob and I bonded in our shared experience of having endured trauma in our lives. I hope that I have been as supportive to him in his recovery as he has been for me in mine. I fully support the Way to Victory mission to construct a therapeutic ranch – a place of healing and comfort to victims and families who suffered trauma. So when I got the call from Rob asking if I'd could and would crew for Race Across the West... I immediately told him to sign me up! I’ll assist in driving, navigation and maintaining Rob's nutritional needs, as well as his spirits! One way I’ll contribute to his well-being (and mine!) is by singing and playing guitar in my downtime. My guitar, “Jimi Dean” has been by my side at every race I crewed for him. And, was one factor in missing our flight to Phoenix for Javalina 100 a few years back. That day, Jimi Dean, Kristen and I were threatened with being evicted from the Newark airport while waiting to catch the next flight... good grief. Thankfully, we all made it to Phoenix and Rob finished that race – very sun burnt – red as a lobster! I will also contribute to the Way to Victory RAW Crew, in a professional capacity as well, as a multimedia/graphic designer and marketing professional. I look forward to assisting the crew in documenting and producing media to share our adventure during the Race Across the West.

                I am one of the founding members of the Otisville Bike Club along with The Woods  Boys. We got hooked on cycling in the mid 70s watching the Tour De France and trying to replicate what those athletes were doing. Growing up in the mountains we had plenty of places to try. The Woods boys were climbers for sure and I have no doubt Rob will be motivated. We took on just about every mountain in the state of New York and there are a lot of them. I became fascinated with the way the bicycles( we were all Colnago dudes) were put together. There were specialty tools needed and I start building bikes and wheels for the team.
                When Ben called me and told me what Rob was up to with RAW and sent me pictures of their NCOM adventure, told me they needed help, I was on board. We have some experience with road trips...just a little lol. Looking foward to the Oceanside to Durango adventure and bringing awareness to The Way To Victory. We all are like family and thats because we helped each other growing up. We all need help especially kids that didnt get a fair shake.
                Okay Robbie Lets Do This!!

                I have always loved cycling, in the mid to late 70s, a group of young men decided to all get bicycles. Spearheaded by the Woods Brothers and other neighborhood friends, we gained a passion for riding day and night on the surrounding roads of our region...the Hudson Valley...Riding daily into the darkness of the night was routine for a bunch of young guys looking for a simple way to escape.
                I have spent the last 20 year as a substance abuse counselor and I am also a graduate of the culinary Institute.
                I signed up for this adventure because I believe in The Way To Victory...Ive known these guys my whole life and we all just want to give the youngsters inspiration to know that all things are possible.

                I met Ben Woods (Robert’s Brother) in September 2019 at the Prairie Peddler in Butler, Ohio. We struck up a conversation and he introduced me to his firestarter business.
                Ben and I swapped information and we ended up negotiating a deal. I would make him a website and in return he would pay me $400 plus one of his firestarters.
                In December 2020 I received a call from Ben. This is not too unusual as I always stay in contact with my clients.
                Ben informed me that his brother was riding a bike race to support children in need and ask if I would join. I immediately said yes. I am a full
                support of Robert’s cause and I am very excited for this journey. Let's do this Rob!
