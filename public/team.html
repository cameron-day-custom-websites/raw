                “Rob, in two sentences or less, why do you have to do this bicycle race, Race Across America? The question stunned me. “Well, all my life I’ve always ridden bicycles and I’ve always wanted to do something like this.” I continued to tell my life story and 3 more sentences into my story I hear, “That’s enough, I don’t hear you anymore.” I sat there in deep thought for a minute and realized, people are going to ask me that question a lot and I really do need to narrow my response. My purpose must be confident. And the truth is, anything after two sentences does become noise. Yesterday on a leisure bike ride, it became perfectly clear about why I need to complete RAAM. My sister gave me a Bible over 30+ years ago. And on the cover of that Bible are the words in big letters, The Way. And inside those letters is a picture of a solo cyclist breaking away from the peloton. In one sentence, why am doing RAAM? Because I need to proclaim the truth that Jesus gave us in John 14:7, “I am the way and the truth and the life and be the comforting hands of Jesus. That’s why I’m doing RAAM, to show the world that in my suffering from Oceanside, California to Annapolis, Maryland, it will provide rest and comfort to those who are suffering from sexual abuse. I will ride for those who want to quit on life and show them the Way. Whenever my suffering becomes too much, I will ask Jesus to give me the strength to endure. And I know without a doubt, that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.   
                Robert Woods is the founder of The Way to Victory Foundation. He is a father of 5, grandfather of 10, and a survivor of trauma himself. He is retired from public service, holds a PhD in educational leadership, and is a licensed Educational Administrator and academic teacher. His doctoral studies focused on transformative learning and synchronicity. Understanding transformative learning guided his path for creating the foundation. He will use that understanding to help others experience positive transformation in their lives. Robert is inspired by athletes such as ultramarathoner Scott Jurek, and bicyclist, Greg LeMond. Robert’s life ambition has been to offer love and support to children and adults who have had to endure the horrors of abuse and trauma.

                I have always loved cycling, in the mid to late 70s, a group of young men decided to all get bicycles. Spearheaded by the Woods Brothers and other neighborhood friends, we gained a passion for riding day and night on the surrounding roads of our region...the Hudson Valley...Riding daily into the darkness of the night was routine for a bunch of young guys looking for a simple way to escape.
                I have spent the last 20 year as a substance abuse counselor and I am also a graduate of the culinary Institute.
                I signed up for this adventure because I believe in The Way To Victory...Ive known these guys my whole life and we all just want to give the youngsters inspiration to know that all things are possible.

                I thought since I personally do not race bikes I would just share a bike related story from my youth.  I remember my first experience learning to ride a bike. The bike wasn't mine, it was a big heavy adult bike (1960's model).   I was determined to ride that bike, after many failed attempts and a few falls I finally succeeded.  I can remember my excitement when I was able to ride from one end of the block to the other.  I eventually got my own bike  I remember giving some kid in the neighborhood $5 for his bike that lasted me about a week or two, I think I sold it for $4 to somebody that knew how to fix it..  I was ten or eleven years old when I went to the local Firestone store downtown by myself and laid away my first ten speed, it was bright yellow with white wrapped curled handle bars.  I always enjoyed riding my bikes around town over to the park swimming pool and through the woods, popping wheelies and going over jumps.  I still ride today for exercise and pleasure, mostly on bike trails.
                
                I met my friend Ben Woods in the Fall of 2018 either in Columbia SC or Richmond VA.  Ben was selling and demonstrating his fire starters a couple a booths down from me at a show we were vendors in, Ben came over to me and introduced himself, we were doing a lot of the same shows and over a short period of time we became good friends.  In September of 2020 Ben asked me if I would be interested in being a crew member to help his brother Rob in the NCOM bike race held in October of 2020.  I was a little hesitant at first not having any experience and not knowing what to expect, but then I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to experience a part of the country I have never seen and be part of a unique adventure.  I have been living in my van since October 30 2019 so I didn't have to pack, I just filled up my van gas tank and drove to Dallas/Fort Worth area where Ben lives.  We left out a day or two later in my van and met his brother Rob in Alpine TX.  Rob completed the 375 mile NCOM bike race and qualified for RAW and RAAM.  I really enjoyed the experience of the bike race, enjoying it with friends. Tranquility, natural beauty and a few wild animals was part of the perks.  I am looking forward to the next challenge with Rob and the rest of the crew for Race Across the West (RAW) and I will again have the privilege to be a part of his/our journey by doing what is asked of me to the best of my ability to help Rob complete the Race Across the West (RAW).
                  
                I love nature and animals.  I am a pescatarian, a van dweller (by choice) and I like exploring and trying knew things.  My passion growing up was mostly music. Drums are my main instrument, I play guitar just for my personal enjoyment.  I'm planning to bring my Cedar Bongo Cajon to jam out some tunes.
                  
                Thank you for your support of The Way to Victory, Rob Woods and the crew!

                Carolyn Peabody, crew member of Way to Victory R.A.W. race team, multimedia/graphic designer and marketing communications professional. I have proudly supported Rob Woods as an endurance and Iron Man crew member with his wife and my best friend, Kristen Woods, for many years. Rob and I bonded in our shared experience of having endured trauma in our lives. I hope that I have been as supportive to him in his recovery as he has been for me in mine over the years. I fully support the Way to Victory mission to construct a therapeutic  ranch designed to provide healing and comfort to victims and families that struggle to cope with trauma. So when I got the call from Rob asking if I'd could and would crew for Race Across the West... I immediately told him to sign me up!
                As a crew member I expect to assist in driving (there will be lots of driving!), navigation, maintaining Rob's nutritional needs as well as his spirits! One way I contribute to his well-being is by singing and playing guitar during rest periods and in my downtime on the course. My guitar, “Jimi Dean” has been by my side at every race I crewed for him. And, was one factor in missing our flight to Phoenix for Javalina 100 a few years back. Later that day, Jimi Dean, Kristen and I were threatened with being evicted from the airport while we waited for the next flight. So Jimi Dean's presence wasn't completely comforting in this instance... good grief. None the less, we all made it to Phoenix and Rob finished that challenging desert race – very sun burnt – red as a lobster! Good grief, indeed!
                I will also contribute to the Way to Victory Foundation and crew in a professional capacity as well as a multimedia/graphic designer and marketing professional. I have been employed 15 years as a Marketing Communications Specialist and Multimedia Designer for a large global corporation. In addition, I develop brand-informed graphics and media as a freelance artist for Strumma~Grl Designs. I look forward to assisting the crew in documenting and producing media to share our adventure during the Race Across the West.

                I am one of the founding members of the Otisville Bike Club along with The Woods  Boys. We got hooked on cycling in the mid 70s watching the Tour De France and trying to replicate what those athletes were doing. Growing up in the mountains we had plenty of places to try. The Woods boys were climbers for sure and I have no doubt Rob will be motivated. We took on just about every mountain in the state of New York and there are a lot of them. I became fascinated with the way the bicycles( we were all Colnago dudes) were put together. There were specialty tools needed and I start building bikes and wheels for the team.
                When Ben called me and told me what Rob was up to with RAW and sent me pictures of their NCOM adventure, told me they needed help, I was on board. We have some experience with road trips...just a little lol. Looking foward to the Oceanside to Durango adventure and bringing awareness to The Way To Victory. We all are like family and thats because we helped each other growing up. We all need help especially kids that didnt get a fair shake.
                Okay Robbie Lets Do This!!
